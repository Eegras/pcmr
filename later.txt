            A PC specifically configured to run Mac OSX is often called a "Hackintosh". Since Apple switched to Intel processors around 2005, users have been able to install and set up OSX to run on most PCs since (assuming you use OSX-compatible hardware). Although it does require about an hour or two of effort, the amount you save and gain by going with a PC over a Mac far outnumbers those two hours of work if aligned to an hourly salary of ~$15-40. Our friends over at /r/Hackintosh offer a lot of help and information on the topic, check them out!

            Of course, if Mac OSX isn't your thing, there's always Linux. Glorious, beautiful, stable, free, and customizable. Among the popular "flavors" are Ubuntu, ElementaryOS, Fedora, Manjaro, and many others.
